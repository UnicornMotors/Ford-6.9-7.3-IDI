# Guide: 6.9L, 7.3L IDI DIESEL FUEL INJECTOR CODES
|Injector Code|Model Year(s)|Notes|
|-------------|-------------|-----|
|A & AA|1983|No longer manufactured. Engine serial number 59,207 and below.|
|B|1984 - 1992|Manufactured by Bosch|
|BB|1984 - 1992|Manufactured by Delphi|
|D|1984 - 1992|Manufactured by Stanadyne|
|E|1992.5 - 1994|Naturally aspirated 7.3L IDI diesel only|
|G|1992.5 - 1994|Factory turbocharged 7.3L IDI diesel only|

"A and AA injectors were produced to identical specifications by two separate manufacturers. Similarly, B, BB, and D code injectors are built to the same specifications, but by different manufacturers (see chart above). A and AA injector codes, only used for one model year, have long been retired. B/BB/D code injectors feature an increased nozzle flow volume. Interestingly, B/BB/D series injectors have a lower ~1,875 psi opening pressure than the A/AA injector's ~2,075 psi opening pressure.

E and G code injectors are for 1992.5 to 1994 model year engines only. The injection pump on naturally aspirated engines was changed during this time and only E code injectors should be used. Likewise, only G code injectors are compatible in factory turbo applications. Do not attempt to put a naturally aspirated injector in a turbocharged engines. Engines from these model years will run best with the injectors they were designed with and if you're hunting for greater performance, injectors are not a viable solution for these applications.

"The Return Lines are connected to the top of each injector. They have a rubber hose that connects each inj, then to the IP, and return fuel line to the tank. Each inj has a plastic cap with fittings for the small rubber hose's to connect them together. Under each of these caps are two rubber O-Rings that seal the cap to the inj. These rubber o-rings and the rubber hoses can become brittle, and shrink. Allowing air into the fuel system. Air in the fuel will cause hard starts, no starts, and smoking.

It's a relatively easy fix, and the parts are around $30-35

Again, hard starts doesn't necessarily mean that the return lines are bad. The 6.9l water separator is notorius for allowing air into the fuels system.

There's a couple of really good articles over on a different Ford diesel site. This site will not allow us to link to them. Lost advertising revenues....

But if you go to: oil burners dot net (one word) and look at the IDI tech articles, there's lotsa info on these trucks, not to mention lots of very helpfull owners there.

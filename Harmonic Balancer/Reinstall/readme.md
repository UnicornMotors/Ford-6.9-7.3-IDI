The rest of the installation must be accomplished with a 5/8″ thread bolt and nut.  It will compress the balancer down the shaft without damaging the engine.  While it might seem tempting to pound on the balancer with a mallet or hammer to push it on, this would be a no-no.  It will just cause extreme damage to the crank instead.  The best course of action is obtaining a 6″ long 5/8″ diameter bolt and nut, like this:

>I was unsure about the thread type on the inside of the crank, so I brought my 15/16″ bolt from the crank with me to the hardware store to match up.  It is pretty hard to find this specific item at a typical Home Depot or hardware store, so if you are planning on doing this in the future, you might want to order a Grade Eight 5/8″ fully threaded bolt in advance from McMaster.  The nuts and washers (an assortment of 5/8″ up to 1″ diameter interior hole washers were used) are easy enough to obtain at any decent store, but it is imperative to obtain Grade Eight washers.  Standard washers will bend and warp with almost no resistance, and even my high strength washer bent a little under the load of the compression.

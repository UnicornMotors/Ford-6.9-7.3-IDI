# Guide
"In order to promote injector and injection pump longevity, a fuel additive should be used at every fill-up on all IDI diesels. These engines were engineered long before the ULSD (ultra low sulfur diesel) mandate in the U.S. and were designed to run on LSD (low sulfur diesel). Sulfur plays a pivotal role in the lubrication properties of diesel fuel and thus ULSD does not provide sufficient lubricity to maximize the service life of injectors and the injection pump. We highly recommend Opti-Lube XDP or Archoil AR6200 diesel fuel additives. Both additives have earned high remarks and the cost-per-fill-up is more than reasonable.

Unless that old IDI diesel is rotted out  don't try to glue anything to that block. Is just gonna fly off under pressure. Find a different style freeze plug or try driving it in with a big socket that matches the diameter of the hole. That way it doesn't deform and get to loose from beating it. You can also warm up the engine without coolant and put the new plug in the freezer for an hour before you try to put it in. When you do, the block expands and the plug shrinks a little, making it easier to get in and even tighter when it comes back to ambient temperature.

Ben use a deep well socket that's slightly smaller than the freeze plug to hammer it in with ( it's a press fit not a push fit). That way you get even pressure all the way around as you install the plug. Make sure after a couple hits that the plug is going in evenly if not tap gently the edge that is protruding with a hammer and a center punch to even it out. A brass hammer works the best for this. Also some gasket sealant around the contact face of the freeze plug won't hurt anything. The convex side faces out.

Also make sure to clean the surface of the block where the freeze plug goes. Prep is always overlooked

 @Systems Planet  Yeah A few times and the ones he has to use for that block are a massive pain in the butt to get right. It's just a convex disk that you have to get to seat then flatten the disk out to create a hard seal. If you dont get it seated right and flattened out it'll just leak or blow out.

Trick we do is toss the plugs in the freezer overnight. Then exactly like you do it.

## Concave, Chamfer Face
> (kneeling here) could please have arrows, like in a drawing--showing the dimensions?? and a drawing?? of the end of the outer shell, how the chamfer, or bevel is. as this kornfuses me!!!! and does the bevel for the concave of the plug, in the outer shell, match the soft plug before its hammered?? when the center plunger is all the way thru the outer shell--how much distance between the bottom of the plunger--and the outside edge of the barrel with a straight edge across it? sometimes hard to put dimensions to a part without drawings--thanks from us all!!!!!!!!!!

>Numbers I can do, but if you want pictures, you'll find out real quick why I didn't go into engineering :rotflmao  
>YEs, the bevel in the outer shell matches the plug before it is hammered, the new plug cradles into it perfectly ( which precludes using an aftermarket plug since the ones from Napa are shaped differently ) I believe part of the reason for that angle is also to keep the plug forcing inward and pinned in at the edges and keep it from rolling around and curling back out ( which is one of the common failure modes when the plugs are installed without the tool )

>It's kind of tricky to measure the plunger across the sleeve. I'll have to dig out the good feeler gauges later and see if I can get a decent measurement on that gap. It's amazingly small. What makes this little contraption work is the shape.

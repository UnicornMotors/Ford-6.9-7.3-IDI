Much easier than finding a steel stock or Welding.

# Mold

## Make a mold using Tubing/Pipe & an extra Expansion Plug:

## Or make a 2 piece Clay Mould!
Wrap a thin piece of sheet metal around the 1" Rod to give it enough space to Fit when the Casting Cools. A Aluminum Can would work.

# Furnace
Brass melts at: 930°C (1710°F)

# Use a Press to press out Center of Mold when it cools.

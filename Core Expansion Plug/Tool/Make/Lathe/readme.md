>While I applaud your finding the article I have to agree with Ican. I am very tight with the Ford dealership that was near my old house. I looked at the correct tool and could make one in under an hour on a lathe if I had time. I also know what happens when someone uses the cup-style expansion plug they have a nasty habit of popping out of the block. I went through this when I was younger and didn't know there was a special plug for the 6.9s and 7.3s. I put the same plug in 3 times and had it pop out each time. Thankfully it never hurt the engine. I was about to give up when a friend who was the dealerships diesel tech stopped over. He showed me what I was doing wrong and brought the tool over the next day and the correct plug. I was skeptical but it worked perfect. That was 5 years ago and the plug is still in there dry as a bone.

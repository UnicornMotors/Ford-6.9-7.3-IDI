## [How to replace your Freeze Plugs](https://www.oilburners.net/threads/how-to-replace-your-freeze-plugs.22387/)

>The instructions for replacing your freeze plugs are [right here](https://www.oilburners.net/threads/how-to-replace-your-freeze-plugs.22387/) Follow those instructions and you will have no problems.
>It's not all that hard to pull the engine out of one of these things to get it out where you can replace all teh plugs, and if you have one that has failed, I'd be concerned that someone has replaced the lot of them somewhere along the line and did it the wrong way, because it is extremely rare for a factory plug to leak
>
>When we say dealer plugs, we mean it. There is a measurable difference in the height of the dome and the cut of the taper edges between the factory freeze plugs and ones available from Napa etc and if you were to attempt to use an aftermarlet one with the factory tool , there is simply no way the thing would set properly, there is too much difference in the height to permit proper sealing pressure to be applied and in some cases would fold the plug up on a narrow edge just itching to walk out

# Comment:
>Actually these style core/freeze plugs are not dimpled in the center but rather around the outer circumference when the correct tool is used. There should be no contact of the tool on the crowned portion of the plug.
>Here is a good article on it (the expansion plugs style is the relevant one)

>that shows the correct tool etc.

>Suv... Thats not how our plugs are installed. That artical is for the cup type plugs. Look at what the factory did to install the plugs in any original block. The stainless steel plugs are dimpled in the centers for the proper amount of expansion and driving it in with a socket or lasrge punch wil not tell you if its set properly. The correct tool can only install it so far into the block. The tool has a built in stop and you hear and feel it when its done correctly. That artical is a nice one but its not for us. Its for the cup type plugs.

>That tool is really something special thats for sure. It will only seat the plug to the proper depth by expanding it from the center or very near the center. I feel they do need some sealant applied to them prior to setting them in the block. This tool will hold them in by an area on the driving end thats designed for this. My original block still has the factory freeze plugs in it and they are stainless steel. They are dimpled in the center but the factory tool also has made a larger impression around the center than what I'm currently running. I witnessed the installation of mine done with this special tool and now I'm wondering if maybe it was well worn. I tested the block with 35 lbs of air pressure and used a leak detector agent around every plug. No leaks found and the pressure held for 30 minutes till I let it out. I'm glad none of them popped out because that would have really hurt someone. Anyway I have found 2 of these plugs weeping so slightly that it only leaves a stain on the block down to the pan rail. It doesn't drop off but the block heat drys it . All of my plugs have 3 places where I applied some JB Weld expoy on them just for insureance. This is something I well be watching closely till I either remove all of the plugs and install another set I have but with a better special or custom tool that matches the factory set dimple.....

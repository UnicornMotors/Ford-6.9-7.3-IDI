## Comment: 303D045
>The trans and flywheel needs to come off. Has this engine ever been overhauled... If so only the factory stainless steel freeze plugs are actually designed to fit and work properly. Others fit but they wont last. The brass after market are the worst. The oem plugs actually are ground to fit by cutting into the cast iron block. Do you run any coolant in this rig and was it low so the block froze. These blocks require 7 of these very special concave plugs and its true... Only install them with the special tool... Its made by OTC or Rotunda... They are one & the same... Part number for the tool is 303D045... Figure around $150.00 and probably a back order tool. Some emembers here have them.. You could ask torent or borrow too. Looking at you plug you will see the center in pressed in. Thats what the tool does to it... First it holds the plug in the machined plug hole... Then you hit the center of it to spread out the plug into the lips of the block... It can only be hammered in so far then the tool will not allow any more spread... Its a nicely made two part tool with very special angles made into it. Some jack@ss on the other site felt he was better at this job than me and told any fool that would listen... All you need is a hammer and a punch to install these simple plugs... I have been doing it this way for many years without any comebacks.... I felt he was out of line advising people the wrong way to do something important like this.... Hel... Go on utube and see the wrong way to remove an injection pump with the gear cover in one piece... As far as replacing all 7 plugs is up to you but... To do this you need to pull the engine because several plugs are behind the drivers side oil cooler bundle and both sides motor mounts. Use some sealant on them too... The oem sealant is no longer available so I use permatex avaitaion cement. Some really like hylomar because it will never harden....

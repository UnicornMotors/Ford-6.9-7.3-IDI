>You will need ford Rotunda tool # 303-D045 Expansion Plug Replacer
>Call 1-800-ROTUNDA ( the number rings through to OTC/SPX tools and is administered by Snap On these days, so you may be able to order the tool from a Snap On Truck, I've purchased other Rotunda OTC tools off the snap on truck before so... ) and do expect to get a runaround. They get about $135 for the thing. It's expensive but that turkey holds the outer shape of the plug perfectly keeping it pointed the right direction, while compressing the center the exact amount needed to seat the things in place where they won't walk out and leak. If you've had one come loose after someone installed one incorrectly , It's a miserable, expensive, time consuming thing to have to go back after them to get it right, Buy the tool.

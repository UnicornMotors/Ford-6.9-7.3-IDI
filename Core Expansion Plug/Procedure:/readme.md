## [How to replace your Freeze Plugs](https://www.oilburners.net/threads/how-to-replace-your-freeze-plugs.22387/)

>The instructions for replacing your freeze plugs are [right here](https://www.oilburners.net/threads/how-to-replace-your-freeze-plugs.22387/) Follow those instructions and you will have no problems.
>It's not all that hard to pull the engine out of one of these things to get it out where you can replace all teh plugs, and if you have one that has failed, I'd be concerned that someone has replaced the lot of them somewhere along the line and did it the wrong way, because it is extremely rare for a factory plug to leak

>When we say dealer plugs, we mean it. There is a measurable difference in the height of the dome and the cut of the taper edges between the factory freeze plugs and ones available from Napa etc and if you were to attempt to use an aftermarlet one with the factory tool , there is simply no way the thing would set properly, there is too much difference in the height to permit proper sealing pressure to be applied and in some cases would fold the plug up on a narrow edge just itching to walk out

# Comment:
>Actually these style core/freeze plugs are not dimpled in the center but rather around the outer circumference when the correct tool is used. There should be no contact of the tool on the crowned portion of the plug.
>Here is a good article on it (the expansion plugs style is the relevant one)

>If you want a whole powerstroke engine, then you are getting into a big can of beans, bolting it up is just the bigineing, the electrical will be fun to say the least (there is also a different computer for autos than manual trannies).
>
>Just so you know, an older IDI with a turbo will go toe to toe with a 7.3 powerstroke, and theres a lot less to go wrong with them. If Dave Sponaugle chimes in, he can tell you all about it.....

>You can bolt any diesel from an 83 6.9 to a 2003 Power Stroke into the truck.
>It will bolt up to the transmission and the truck frame.
>
>However, an IDI is a mechanical control engine, the throttle cable goes from the throttle pedal to the injection pump.
>It really only needs one wire to run, that is one to open the fuel shut off solenoid.
>
>The Power Stroke has a rheostat on the throttle pedal that is fed into the computer along with 20 other sensors so the computer can tell the injector when and how much fuel to fire.
>So the throttle pedal assembly has to swap.
>Computer, need that and all the wiring.
>
>If you want to install a Power Stroke in an IDI truck, go buy a wrecked Power Stroke truck.
>Take every wire out of both trucks cabs, then put the Power Stroke electrical system in the IDI truck.
>
>By the way, the computer also recieves a signal from the VSS in the rear axle on a Power Stroke, so you need to swap the rear axle as well.
>
>I can't say for sure the T444E which is the International version of the Power Stroke uses all the same sensors in the same location as Ford does, but they have to be there somewhere.
>It is going to be a wiring nightmare before it runs.
>
>I spent about 4500 for parts and machine work, did all the labor myself and have a 6.9 that will run with the Strokes or Cummins engines.
>I'll stick with my 6.9 turbo.

>Remember you can buy an entire set of IDI injectors for the cost of one out of a Power Stroke engine.

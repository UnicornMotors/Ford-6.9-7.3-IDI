"IP's (Injection Pumps) are generally good for around 100K miles or so. Depending on lot's of varibles. I run some diesel fuel supplement in every tank, 4oz's. So hopefully mine will last longer.

If I were you, I'd replace the return lines and dump a 16 oz bottle of fuel additive in each tank. Then we'll see how it runs.
